# Xhuti's Defense Portfolio – Value-at-Risk (VaR) Simulation
This project models and visualizes financial portfolio risk using value-at-risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (CVaR) through both historical simulation and Monte Carlo simulation methods.

# Objective
To estimate potential portfolio losses under different confidence intervals that replicate quantitative risk frameworks used in quant-finance institutions.

# Methodology
- Data: Historical equity prices via `yfinance`
- Analysis: Log returns, covariance matrix estimation
- Modeling:
  - Historical Simulation VaR
  - Monte Carlo Simulation VaR
  - Expected Shortfall (CVaR)
- Visualization: Portfolio return distribution, VaR thresholds, stress tests

# Tools & Libraries
Python · NumPy · pandas · SciPy · Matplotlib · Plotly
